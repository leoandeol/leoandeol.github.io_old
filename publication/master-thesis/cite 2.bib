 abstract = {The problem of having a framework to classify graphs is becoming
increasingly important in the era of data. The issue has been tackled since
the beginning of the millennium and there have been significant progress.
This report introduces all necessary knowledge to understand the topic
and then reviews different graph kernels while focusing on a random walk
kernel and its optimization. Some experiments are then conducted to
verify the information given by the state of the art, and some attempts
are made to accelerate the different methods to compute the kernel.},
